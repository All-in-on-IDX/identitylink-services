> A Discord bot which prompts the user to enter their DID, and creates a new challenge for them.

## Whats included

1. **Server** to run the verification service - `packages/server`
2. **Test utility** and example implementation - `packages/test-examples`
3. **Discord bot** w/ docker container - `packages/bot`

## Usage

### Create a new Discord Bot

Create a new application at https://discord.com/developers. Don't worry about naming here.

Now in your app, navigate to "Bot" and create a bot. Choose a username and Icon for your bot here.

Leave "Bot Permissions" alone.

Copy the `TOKEN` which we will need for our node app.

Back in this package, copy `.template.env` to `.env` and add the `TOKEN` you just copied.

### Run the bot locally

```bash
node bot.js
```

### Add the bot to your server

In the Discord Application, in "General Information", copy the `CLIENT ID`. Insert it in this URL, and send it to the server admin.

```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<clientID>&scope=bot
```

### Going to Production - Docker
